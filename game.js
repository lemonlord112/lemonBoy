    Same. My Christian faith is something I've been trying to take more seriously this year, especially growing up as a long time atheist. Being a Christian is a pretty big struggle ayeüòÖ? I still have my doubts, I'm sinning far too often, I struggle to wake up on Sundays let alone bring my ass to church, and I question God when I feel like I get hurt undeservingly. But seeing the sacrifices my Christian brothers go through and their high level of faith honestly lights me up.
