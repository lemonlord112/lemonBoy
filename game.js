    This is a STORY ADVENTURE GAME, so don't play if your not in the mood of doing a lot of reading. This is a game about me, Lemon Boy, and how I navigate my life  in our chronically burdening society. I hope you can help me find some meaning in my life as you play.

Then they put their hands over their ears and began shouting. They rushed at him and dragged him out of the city and began to stone him.
   
   You watch as Lemon Boy gets stoned. He's motionless. You can't tell if he's helpless or simply just steadfast. He glances at you before staring into the sky, and you notice a placid grin on his face.
